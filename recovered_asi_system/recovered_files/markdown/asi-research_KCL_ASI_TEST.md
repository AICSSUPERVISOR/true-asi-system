# King's College London: SuperARC Test for ASI

**Source:** https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/new-study-introduces-a-test-for-artificial-superintelligence  
**Date:** April 22, 2025

## SuperARC Test Definition

A new benchmark that uses **advanced compression** and a **specialised type of probability** to find the most likely explanations for Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) without relying on human-focused assumptions.

## Key Finding

**Current leading LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Qwen) are still far from AGI or ASI** and often circle around the same intelligence levels.

## How SuperARC Defines Intelligence

Intelligence is defined in terms of **recursive compression** - repeatedly condensing information to reveal deeper patterns not apparent to LLM chatbots.

### Core Principles

1. **Compression and Predictability Equivalence**
   - The test employs specialized probability
   - Based on the equivalence between compressibility and predictability
   - Established in the theory of randomness

2. **Mathematical Proof**
   - Proves mathematically the equivalence between compression and prediction
   - Shows model abstraction and planning in AI are formally two sides of the same coin

3. **Intelligence Measurement**
   - Intelligence is best measured by the ability to produce approximations to **short computable hypotheses**
   - Must be able to:
     - Reconstruct data
     - Predict data by running code in parallel
     - Simulate many future states
     - Pick the state closer to observation at any given time

## Key Advantages

1. **Moves away from human-centric IQ-style tests**
2. **Fundamental and agnostic measure** of natural and artificial higher cognitive ability
3. **Not based on human-centric single answers**
4. **Makes it difficult for current AI systems to cheat**
   - Current systems implicitly or explicitly train on the very answers they are tested on
   - SuperARC prevents this

## Implications for TRUE ASI

To qualify as TRUE ASI, a system must:
- Excel at recursive compression
- Reveal deeper patterns beyond surface-level responses
- Produce short computable hypotheses
- Simulate and predict future states accurately
- Not rely on memorized answers
- Demonstrate fundamental intelligence, not trained responses
