**Source:** https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/artificial-superintelligence-ASI

## Definition

Artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypothetical software-based system with **intellectual powers beyond those of humans across a comprehensive range of categories and fields of endeavor**.

## Key Criteria to be Considered ASI

**To be considered ASI, a model would need to excel beyond human ability at a range of tasks at a very high level.**

### Core Capabilities Required

1. **Cognition** - Superior to human cognitive abilities
2. **General Intelligence** - Across all domains
3. **Problem-Solving Abilities** - Beyond human capacity
4. **Social Skills** - Superior interpersonal capabilities
5. **Creativity** - More creative than humans

## Technologies Required to Achieve ASI

### 1. Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Use NLP algorithms to replicate natural human language
- Summarize textual data
- Converse with humans
- Generate essays and create visualizations
- Examples: GPT-4, BERT

### 2. Multimodal AI
- Combine visuals, text, speech and other data types
- Process all modalities simultaneously
- Generate images from text prompts

### 3. Neural Networks
- Deep learning software based on human brain neuron operations
- Process multiple functions in parallel or arranged tiers
- Emulate human brain operations
- Evolve capabilities beyond human cognition levels

### 4. Neuromorphic Computing
- Hardware based on neural and synaptic structures of human brain
- Generate more compute power than traditional computers
- Process and store data on same neuron
- High plasticity and fault tolerance

### 5. Evolutionary Algorithms
- Modeled on natural selection and Darwinian evolution
- Generate multitude of AI systems
- Select best-performing models for next generation
- Improve capabilities through competition

### 6. AI-Driven Programming
- Programming generated by AI systems
- Intelligent code generation
- Push AI capabilities further

### 7. AI-Generated Inventions
- Inventions created by AI systems
- Propose unique, beneficial and creative inventions

### 8. Integration
- Converge isolated AI systems into integrated systems
- Necessary for ASI achievement

### 9. Whole Brain Emulation
- Scan entire structure of human brain
- Map exact neural connections
- Create digital replica with human capabilities

### 10. Brain Implants and Hive Minds
- Wearable technologies surgically implanted
- Integrate with brain structure
- Enhance function, cognition, intelligence, creativity

## Benefits of ASI

1. **Improved Problem-Solving**
   - Process and analyze significantly more data than humans
   - Faster and more precise
   - Better decisions in politics, science, healthcare, finance

2. **More Efficiency and Productivity**
   - Automate tasks currently performed by humans
   - Fewer human errors
   - Increased safety, security, productivity, efficiency

3. **Available 24/7**
   - Always available, unlike humans

4. **Innovation and Advancement**
   - More creative than humans
   - Create solutions humans couldn't think of
   - Out-innovate humans in virtually any field
   - Better quality of life

## Path to ASI

**Current State:** Weak/Narrow AI (specific tasks only)
**Next Step:** Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) - perform any task a human can
**Final State:** Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) - superior to humans in every capacity
