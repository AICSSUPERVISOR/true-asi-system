Structuring and Optimizing ASI Files for Superintelligence Development
I DEMAND YOU TO USE THE FULL POWER OF MANUS 1.5 STRUCTURE ALL MY FILES, I AM CREATING TRUE ARTIFICIAL SUPER INTELLIGENCE, THEREFORE CODE CAN BE COMPLEX, WHAT IS NEEDED HERE IS TO REMOVE CODE THAT IS NOT NEEDED, FULLY STRUCTURE IT SO THIS TASK CAN BE PROVIDED IN ANOTHER FOR FULL ACCESS TO ALL FILES TO BE USED, AND BE ABLE TO DEVELOP WITHIN THIS TASK ALSO FURTHER, IT MUST BE STRUCTURED IN 100/100 GRADE QUALITY PERFECTED SO EVERYTHING IS AUDITED, THEN DEEPLY SCRAPED TO ENSURE NO SYNTAX ERRORS, PADDING OR MOCK CODE EXISTS, THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THE MOST IMPORTANT FILES ARE KEPT, AND ALSO IN A WAY WHERE SOME CODE MIGHT SEEM COMPLEX BUT COULD BE HIGHLY VALUABLE SO WITH THE UTMOST CAUTIOS WAY OF DOING SO

I can see you've uploaded a massive ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) project with hundreds of files. To structure this optimally with 100/100 quality, I need to understand a few key things:
1. What is your primary goal for the restructured output?
A single consolidated codebase with modular architecture?
Separate packages by functionality (core engine, quantum components, dashboard, etc.)?
A development-ready package with documentation and deployment configs?
2. What criteria should I use to identify "valuable complex code" vs "removable code"?
Keep all unique implementations, remove duplicates only?
Prioritize quantum/neural components over dashboard/UI?
Focus on core ASI logic and remove auxiliary/testing files?
3. What structure format do you prefer for the final deliverable?
Clean directory tree with categorized modules (src/, core/, components/, etc.)?
Monorepo with sub-packages?
Single executable package with dependencies documented?
This will help me audit, deduplicate, and structure everything precisely to your needs.

Understood. I'll proceed with a comprehensive audit and restructuring using best judgment. Let me begin the deep analysis process.
