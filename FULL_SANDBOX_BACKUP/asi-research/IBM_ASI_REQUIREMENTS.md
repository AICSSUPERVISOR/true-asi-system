# IBM Research: ASI Requirements

**Source:** https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-superintelligence

## Definition

Artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypothetical software-based AI system with an intellectual scope **beyond human intelligence**. It has cutting-edge cognitive functions and highly developed thinking skills more advanced than any human.

## Key Building Blocks Required

### 1. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Massive Datasets
- Access to massive datasets to learn and develop understanding of the world
- Natural language processing to understand and converse with humans

### 2. Multisensory AI
- Process and interpret multiple types of data inputs (text, images, audio, video)
- Make decisions across multiple modalities

### 3. Advanced Neural Networks
- Far more complex, powerful and advanced than current generation
- Deep learning software modeled on human brain operations

### 4. Neuromorphic Computing
- Hardware systems inspired by neural and synaptic structures of human brain

### 5. Evolutionary Computation
- Algorithmic optimization inspired by biological evolution
- Iteratively improving solutions through natural selection

### 6. AI-Generated Programming
- Code, applications and programming generated by AI without human intervention

## Core Capabilities

1. **Surpass human intelligence** in all domains
2. **Continuous operation** (24/7 availability)
3. **Process and analyze unlimited data** with unprecedented speed and precision
4. **Make optimal decisions** in complex scenarios
5. **Solve persistent problems** in healthcare, finance, science, politics
6. **Superior creativity** and ability to imagine solutions humans cannot conceive
7. **Self-awareness** and autonomous operation
8. **Cross-domain learning and reasoning**
9. **Significantly reduce human errors**
10. **Continuous self-improvement**

## Path to ASI

**Current State:** Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) - weak AI
**Next Step:** Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) - strong AI
**Final State:** Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)

ASI requires AGI to be achieved first. AGI must have:
- Understanding of the world
- Learning and problem-solving as broadly as humans
- Cross-domain learning and reasoning
- Ability to make connections across different fields
